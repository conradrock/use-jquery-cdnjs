* An extremely light plugin to load jquery and jquery migrate scripts from CloudFlare CDNjs, which is extremely fast and is more than likely cached already by the enduser.
* It accelerates the loading of at least 2 seconds.
* It is written in 10 lines of code and weighs about 0.005 MB
* It automatically detects the version of the script used by your theme and makes a request to it.
